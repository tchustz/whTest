# Data Fellowship: Module 1 Overview 
3 hours

## Module Overview 
In the first WhiteHat module, apprentices will learn how to describe the data analytics lifecycle and set out details, activities and roles at each stage using a real-world example. They will learn how to design effective **project briefs** which **communicate expectations to stakeholders.**

In the second half of the module, we will identify **business specific rules** related to datasets and data characteristics that will influence project design and analysis. Finally, they will learn how to describe the key characteristics of the different **data formats** and how to work with them.


## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, apprentices should be able to:

In-Class
 - Describe the **data analytics lifecycle** and set out details, activities and roles at each stage in a real-world example
- Design effective **project briefs** which **communicate expectations to stakeholders**
- Identify **business specific rules** related to datasets and data characteristics that will influence project design and analysis
- Describe the key characteristics of the different **Data Formats** and how to work with them


Assignment 
Part 1: 
- **Task:** Using the data analytics lifecycle, map the stages and activities to a real project you’ve been involved in. Provide a write up of how the project went. 
- **What we’re looking for:** List the lifecycle steps with activities from your chosen project under each step. Provide a project summary, discussing how project planning and delivery went (Did it follow the stages? What were the issues? Were all steps involved?) - **Assessment criteria we are looking at:** An understanding of the different lifecycle steps and how each fits within your project.

Part 2
- Think about a data project at work that you are about to start (or would really like to undertake) and create a project brief that you would present to a potential project sponsor. 
- You must ensure that the brief contains all the necessary information whilst pitching the technical details to the correct level. 
- Once complete, email your project brief to your coach as if they were the project sponsor. 
- You must communicate why you are sending the brief as well as considering whether additional explanation/justification is required.

Both the brief and email can be used as Portfolio evidence plus we'll get them to reflect on the importance of being clear with requirements and highlighting any difficulties they had getting the necessary information especially regarding data/business context. We'll also guide them to discuss GDPR and whether or not it applies to the data for their chosen project.
